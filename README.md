## Introduction
Welcome to **Listé**, a simple and open-sourced to-do list app for everyone.

Whether you're a developer or user using the app, I'd love to add on the number of parties involved in this project. I plan to cater to all; however, I'm only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

## Getting Started
Thanks for your interest in trying out this project! The explanation on how to get started is fairly long, so I've moved it to [the wiki](https://github.com/arashnrim/Liste/wiki/Building-List%C3%A9). Check it out to get started!

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, I recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), it is strongly advised against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Listé is an existing project, and subsequently a version 1.0 (latest 1.0.3) exists. While the App Store contains the app, the app is currently unusable at this point as I'm rewriting the code. Here's what I plan for the next few versions, starting from version 1.1.0:

Listé 1.1.0
- Reintroduced user interface. I've taken the design of version 1.0 and redesigned the interface a little, making the app more usable and available to more features.

Listé 1.2.0
- Collaborative Lists. A simple, innovative way to share a List with people.
- Local storage. Version 1.0 emphasises a mostly online structure, unnecessarily using data to sync with the online database (Firebase). In the new version, I'm only making Collaborative Lists (a new feature) store data online; everything else uses UserDefaults or other forms of local storage.

## Contributing
